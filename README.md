## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

While working on my master's thesis, I became obsessed with Youtuber Steven Bridges' series on blackjack and card counting in casions. Therefore, to increase my proficiency in C++ and to investigate for myself the actual effectiveness of card counting, I created this program during study breaks from my thesis to simulate the actual effectiveness of card counting in a casino.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

### Prerequisites

No external libraries are used. CMake 3.5 is the minimum version required.

### Installing

After running ```main.cpp```, a ```stats.txt``` file will be generated in the main directory showing the history of the player's money after 10 shoes of casino Blackjack.
